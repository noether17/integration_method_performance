# Description
This repository is for testing the relative performance of various methods of integrating differential equations. To simplify the comparison, each method will be run using an adaptive step technique intended to reach a specified target accuracy. This target accuracy will be varied in order to get a sense of how the relative performance of each method depends on accuracy requirements. In addition, a variety of systems will be integrated to show how the type of system being integrated affects the relative performance of different methods.

## Integration Methods
Euler Method
Fourth-Order Runge Kutta

## Systems
Simple Sinusoid
